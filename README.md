# pythonzmq
This project implements a zeromq server to receive API requests from a (implemented for nodejs) server on the same lines of event driven loop of 
nodejs server and stores the configurations in a sqllite database.
The message format is json and hence it takes care of parsing the json and updating the values with the predefined keys.
Note, the sqlite database keys are predefined and it will only allow updation of the database.

<Compilation and usage to be updated soon>
